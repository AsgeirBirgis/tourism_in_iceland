Visualizations from data provided by the Icelandic tourist board. 
After working in tourism in Iceland for an extended period, I had lingering questions about the evolution of Icelandic tourism. When it came time to choose a subject for my final 
project at the Codecademy Data Analytics path, I found data sets about Iceland's tourism and how it had changed through the years. 
Luckily The Iceland Tourist Board provides excellent and detailed data about this subject.
